<h3>1. Account </h3>
Each account on a website has a set of access flags that represent a users access. <br/><br/>
Update and extend the enum so that it contains three new access flags:<br/>
(1) A Writer access flag that is made up of the Submit and Modify flags.<br/>
(2) An Editor access flag that is made up of the Delete, Publish and Comment flags.<br/>
(3) An Owner access that is made up of the Writer and Editor flags.<br/>
